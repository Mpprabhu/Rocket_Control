# Rocket Control

## Overview

**Rocket Control** is a physics-based 2D game where players pilot a rocket through various levels filled with obstacles. The game focuses on realistic physics and precise handling, requiring players to carefully control their rocket's thrust and direction to navigate challenging environments. This project was developed as part of my learning journey through various online courses.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Gameplay:**
  - Realistic rocket movement and physics, including gravity and thrust mechanics.
  - Precise handling controls that challenge the playerâ€™s piloting skills.
  
- **Multiple Levels:**
  - Various levels with increasing difficulty, featuring different obstacles and terrains.
  
- **Dynamic Challenges:**
  - Moving obstacles, narrow passages, and rotating platforms that test reflexes and control.

- **Checkpoint System:**
  - Progress-saving checkpoints that allow players to resume from specific points after a crash.

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** 
  - Safely guide your rocket through each level, avoiding obstacles and landing at the designated landing zone.
  
- **Controls:**
  - **Thrust:** Use the `Up Arrow` or `W` key to activate the rocket's thrust.
  - **Rotate Left:** Use the `Left Arrow` or `A` key to rotate the rocket counterclockwise.
  - **Rotate Right:** Use the `Right Arrow` or `D` key to rotate the rocket clockwise.
  
- **Difficulty:**
  - The game starts with simpler levels to help players get accustomed to the controls and physics, gradually introducing more complex challenges.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity** for game development
- **C#** for scripting and implementing game logic
- **Physics Engine** within Unity to simulate realistic rocket movement

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.3.10f1 or later
- A computer capable of running Unity projects
